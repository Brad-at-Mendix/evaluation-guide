The Mendix Platform offers a completely integrated visual development environment for building multi-channel apps. Developers can rapidly build, visualise and deploy multi-channel apps using the drag-and-drop interfaces of the Web and Desktop Modelers.

Your users can build rich [front-ends](https://mendix-platform-guide.cfapps.io/platform-guide-new/app-capabilities/5.1-front-end) for multi-channel apps (for both [web](https://mendix-platform-guide.cfapps.io/platform-guide-new/app-capabilities/5.3-web-apps) and [mobile](https://mendix-platform-guide.cfapps.io/platform-guide-new/app-capabilities/5.4-mobile-apps)) from a single model that supports reuse and a consistent look and feel. Also, the Mendix’s [Atlas UI](https://atlas.mendix.com/) framework enables them  to create beautiful interfaces quickly: further details on Atlas can be found here

Finally, in addition to the many standard components, Mendix offers several options for extending the platform. These options are presented in section [4 How Can I Extend the Mendix Front-End?](https://mendix-platform-guide.cfapps.io/platform-guide-new/app-capabilities/5.1-front-end#extend) of Front-End and section [3 How can I Customize the Look and Feel of My Apps?](https://mendix-platform-guide.cfapps.io/platform-guide-new/app-capabilities/5.2-ui-design#customize) of User Interface Design.

## How Does Mendix Support Multi-Channel Applications?

Mendix provides a single development paradigm for building Multi-Channel apps. From simple responsive users experiences to complete offline mobile apps with client-side logic and data synchronisation; and everything in between. 

Both business and IT developers can now create Multi-Chanel apps through our visual drag and drop development environment using a single model base and skill set to serve multiple use cases including mBaaS.  Consolidating skills, reducing complexity and accelerating business value to meet the demands of today’s highly mobile workforce. 

For details, see [How Does Mendix Support Multi-Channel Applications?](front-end#support-multi-channel).

## How Do Mendix Mobile Apps Work?

With Mendix, users can develop, deploy, test, and manage mobile apps from a single integrated visual development environment which uses the popular [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) framework to provide access to native mobile device features. Mobile applications can operate in an online or offline mode, storing data locally and synchronising with the Mendix server which provides a complete mBaaS. 

The Mendix mBaaS provides over the air updates removing the need to redeploy applications to the app stores to deploy new or updated functionality.

For details, see [How Do Mendix Mobile Apps Work?](mobile-apps#mobile-apps-work).

## How Can I Build an Offline Mobile App?

The most important thing to mention is that you build offline apps using the same tools as online and responsive apps, consolidating your skills and reuse across your deployment landscape. By simply specifying an offline profile inside your app model, and setting the data source of your required offline pages to be offline, the Mendix Platform will automatically manage both the consistency and deployment of those model artefacts that are required to be synchronised to the device to run locally. Also, Mendix will create and synchronise a local SQL database to persist data between the client and server automatically, requiring no additional skills to manage data movement when on or offline.
