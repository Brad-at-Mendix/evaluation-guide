With the Mendix Platform, you can build multi-channel apps that deliver great user experiences on any device. User interface design is refined through an integrated Mendix framework that is fully responsive and extensible. Client-side logic can be easily configured, and the design patterns you create can be reused throughout your Mendix apps.

You can build, preview, test, publish, update, and extend web and mobile apps via different capabilities of the Mendix Platform. You can also build rich offline apps that always work, helping you to fulfill various business needs.

Mendix apps pull from a tremendous array of data sources while maintaining the strongest app security. The data can be queried, managed, and mapped throughout the platform. Integration is accomplished via consuming and exposing REST, SOAP, OData, web, and other services.

Finally, the options for cloud deployment reflect the importance Mendix places on its cloud-native architecture and design.

The chapters and pages give a detailed presentation of all the capabilities of Mendix applications.
