IBM has integrated the provisioning and deployment of Mendix applications directly into the IBM Cloud. This is done using the IBM Toolchain and CI/CD pipeline integration.

In principle, there are no limitations on consuming any service from IBM Cloud. However, together with IBM, Mendix has created some out-of-the box connectors that accelerate development on top of the services even more.

These are the services available as connectors:

 * [IBM Watson Connector Suite](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/2860/) (a collection of connectors for IBM Watson cognitive services)
 * [IBM Mobile Analytics Widget](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/106305/)
 * [IBM App Launch Connector](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/106382/)
 * [IBM App ID Connector](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/106198/)
 * [IBM Weather Company Connector](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/106297/)
