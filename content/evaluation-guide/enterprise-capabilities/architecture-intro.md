Mendix is a high productivity aPaaS environment built on a modern, open cloud-native architecture for scalability and the freedom to deploy to virtually any infrastructure, including Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud-Foundry. The platforms statelsss server architecture supports on-demand vertical and horizontal scaling, while our public cloud provides self-service scaling and is highly available (HA) by default.

Openness and extensibility hooks are available across the platform, from the client and server-side APIs for custom model extensions to the platform APIs and our open-source Model SDK, which allows you to integrate Mendix with your existing tools (CICD/ Dev Ops) and build scripts to manage/monitor and modify the core metadata of your apps.
