## 1 Why Mendix? {#vision}

The founders of Mendix learned it the hard way: delivering software that fulfills business needs is extremely hard and fails more often than it succeeds. Mendix was founded on the belief that software development could only be significantly improved if there was a paradigm shift. And that’s exactly what Mendix introduced.

Mendix is fundamentally changing how software is created. With the current generation of the Mendix Platform, business applications can be created 10 times faster in close collaboration with (or even wholly owned by) the business while IT is in control.

Mendix was founded with a two-point mission that still holds true today:

* To bridge the business-IT gap and enable organizations with a whole new way to innovate and differentiate with apps
* Build a company that will attract, develop, excite and retain exceptional people

And thus Mendix came into creation. The name "Mendix" is derived from the verb *to mend*, which means to repair anything that is broken, torn, defaced, or the like.

Mendix is here to mend the relationship between business and IT.

### 1.2 What Is the Vision Behind Mendix?

The fundamental belief at Mendix is that software should not be something just for IT. Every company needs to become a software company to survive in a software-driven world. The whole organization needs to be collaborating on the lifeblood of the business, which is software. The future of each company depends on it. Experimentation and innovation by people that know the business domain is key to survival.

The Mendix vision is to enable a whole range of people with different backgrounds to be successful in creating software that delivers actual business value. Mendix enables business domain experts through abstraction, automation, and intelligent assisted development. Mendix enables professional developers by giving them low-level control, extensibility using programming languages like Java and JavaScript, and a completely open meta-model as well as the APIs to interact with any part of the Mendix Platform, including the models.

This results in the three core principles of the Mendix Platform:

* **Speed** – In a world that is changing ever faster, IT backlogs are overflowing. To change that, software needs to be created much faster. App development must take place at the speed of the business.
* **Collaboration** – The talent gap for software development is only widening. Teaching more people to program will not solve this, as the gap is exponentially growing. So, we need to involve a much broader audience in software development. They key to faster and better software delivery is collaboration. The Mendix Platform brings the people with ideas together with the people with the technical aptitude to execute those ideas.
* **Control** – The Mendix Platform is focused on delivering enterprise software. Speed and collaboration are easy for simple applications, but for enterprise-grade software that needs to operate in a complex environment, it is more difficult. With Mendix, security, performance, scalability, and governance are built in. This means that the business can be enabled while IT stays in control.

### 3.1 Low Code and No Code in a Single Platform

Both no-code and low-code tools use visual, model-driven development concepts to speed up and transform application development.

No-code tools (as the name suggests) enable users to build apps without writing any code. Their target audience consists of business analysts, business developers, and citizen developers – users with no or very little experience in software development. Low-code tools add another dimension, which is the ability to extend application models with custom code, such as Java extensions. This makes low-code tools appealing to a far wider range of developers with any level of software development experience.

In a way, the "low-code" and "no-code" labels can be misleading. Is the difference whether people need to code or not? At Mendix, we think the main distinction is found in the types of people using these tools.

Organizations wanting to harness the power of both groups should look for a rapid application development platform that is appealing to both business developers and professional developers. Each user should feel comfortable and empowered to build apps themselves. But the real value is contained in enabling teams of developers from both business and IT with mixed experience levels to collaborate on a single platform and be focused on achieving the same goal – building apps that solve real business problems with unprecedented speed and out-of-the box control.

The Mendix Platform contains the Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler, which are visual modeling environments that combine to deliver an integrated and model-driven app development experience across the full continuum of users. What is more, these modeling environments are integrated with the Mendix Development Portal as the backbone for collaborative modeling.
