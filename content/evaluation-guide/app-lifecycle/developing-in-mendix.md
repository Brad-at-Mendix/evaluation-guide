Mendix is a model-driven development environment designed to cater to the needs of today's enterprise software developers, which includes line-of-business developers, citizen developers, and experienced software engineers. Through our highly extensible visual modeling suite, developers of all skill sets can participate in the designing, building, and deploying of apps using both no- and low-code development tools.

## How Does Mendix Enable Model-Driven Development?

Mendix enables model-driven development through the Web and Desktop Modelers, which provide visual drag-and-drop development tools for UI, data, logic, and navigation using no- and low-code development. The resulting model is then executed at runtime, thus removing the overhead of code generation, which breaks the bond between model and application while producing tomorrow's legacy. Model execution, on the other hand, provides significant advantages, as it supports the easy accommodation of changes, controlled extensions, and dynamic monitoring analysis at runtime.  

For details, see the [How Does Mendix Enable Model-Driven Development?](app-development#enable) section.

## How Does Mendix Support Different Developer Profiles?

Mendix is designed to support the spectrum of users who are necessary for building enterprise apps in today's software-driven world. This includes line-of-business developers, citizen developers, business analysts, and professional developers.  Each of these roles can collaborate in Mendix through an integrated set of tools across the entire software development lifecycle.

## How Does Mendix Support Multi-User Development?

Project team members are connected instantly and interactively to changes and updates such as new requirements, software revisions, updates, and shipments as well as test results and feedback loops from end-users. This live feed becomes the backbone for the Mendix collaborative process, while visual models and drag-and-drop WYSYWG editors lower the barrier to entry for business users to participate in the development process.
