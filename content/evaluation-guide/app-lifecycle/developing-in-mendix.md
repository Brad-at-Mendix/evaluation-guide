Mendix is a model-driven development environment designed to cater to the needs of today's enterprise software developers, which includes, line of business developers, citizen developers and experienced software engineers. Through our highly extensible, visual modeling suite developers of all skill sets can participate in the design, build and deployment of apps using both no and low-code development tools.

## How Does Mendix Enable Model-Driven Development?

Mendix enables Model-Driven development through our Web and Desktop modelers which provide visual drag and drop development tools for four UI, Data, Logic and Navigation using no and low-code development. The resulting model is then executed at runtime, removing the overhead of code generation, which breaks the bond between model and application and produces tomorrows legacy. Model execution, on the other hand, provides significant advantages, supporting easy accommodation of changes, controlled extensions and dynamic monitoring analysis at runtime.

## How Does Mendix Support Different Developer Profiles?

Mendix is designed to support the spectrum of users who are necessary for building enterprise apps in today's software-driven world. This includes line-of-business developers, citizen developers, business analysts, and professional developers.  Each of these roles can collaborate in Mendix through an integrated set of tools across the entire software development lifecycle.

## How Does Mendix Support Multi-User Development?

Project team members are connected instantly and interactively to changes and updates: such as new requirements, software revisions, updates and shipments; as well as test results and feedback loops from end users. This live feed becomes the backbone for the collaborative process, while visual models and drag and drop WYSYWG editors lower the barrier to entry for business users to participate in the development process.
