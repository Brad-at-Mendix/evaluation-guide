## How Does Mendix Enable Model-Driven Development?

Mendix enables Model-Driven development through our Web and Desktop modelers which provide visual drag and drop development tools for four UI, Data, Logic and Navigation using no and low-code development. The resulting model is then executed at runtime, removing the overhead of code generation, which breaks the bond between model and application and produces tomorrows legacy. Model execution, on the other hand, provides significant advantages, supporting easy accommodation of changes, controlled extensions and dynamic monitoring analysis at runtime.
