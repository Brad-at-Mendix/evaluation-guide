Mendix is a model-driven development environment designed to cater to the needs of today's enterprise software developers. Through our highly extensible visual-modeling suite, developers of all skillsets can participate in the design, building, and deploying of applications using both no-code and low-code development tools.

The Mendix Web Modeler is a browser-based, no-code development environment for business developers. It employs WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop tools for data, UI, logic, and navigation. The Desktop Modeler builds on these visual editors to offer a sophisticated local development environment for the professional developer.

## How Does Mendix Enable Model-Driven Development?

Mendix enables model-driven development through our Web and Desktop Modelers, which provide visual drag-and-drop development tools for no-code and low-code development. The resulting model is then executed at runtime, removing the overhead of code generation, which breaks the bond between model and application while producing tomorrow's legacy. Model execution, on the other hand, provides significant advantages, supporting the easy accommodation of changes, controlled extensions, and dynamic monitoring analysis at runtime.
