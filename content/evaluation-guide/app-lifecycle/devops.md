## How Does Mendix Support DevOps?

With one-click deployment and out-of-the-box monitoring, the Mendix Platform enables the rapid build, test, release and operation of enterprise applications into production environments by small cross-functional teams working iteratively. Teams can continuously release new functionality to the cloud for automated testing before using two-factor authentication to push updates to live production environments. All of which is carried out under the strict security controls and governance set out by your enterprise requirements.

## How Does Mendix Support Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)?

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are supported at both the Mendix Platform level and via the platform APIs. The APIs enable the integration of external tools to build a delivery pipeline using products like Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services coupled with container technologies like Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and Docker and quality assurance services like Mendix Application Test Suite (ATS), Mendix Application Quality Monitor (AQM), and Selenium.
