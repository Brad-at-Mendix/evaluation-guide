## 1 How Is Requirements Management Positioned in Mendix?

Requirements management is a critical part of the application development lifecycle. Mendix helps to shorten the feedback loop between development teams and users as well as all other stakeholders in order to drive project success, lower costs, and decrease time-to-market.

## 2 How Does Mendix Support Agile Development Teams?

Mendix enables development teams to adopt an Agile approach based on Scrum in which they collaborate closely with internal and external stakeholders in short iterative development cycles. The Mendix Platform supports this way of working out of the box through the following key functionalities:

* Development teams can [capture, refine, and prioritize requirements](requirements-management#requirements-management) for their applications in the Mendix Developer Portal with a full-fledged user-story and task backlog management tool
* Users and other stakeholders can review apps and [provide feedback](feedback-management#feedback-management) to the development team so that apps can be quickly improved, both during development and after go-live
* All the stakeholders of the app under development can be [actively engaged](collaboration-channels#stakeholder-involvement) in the development process through different channels

Mendix helps development teams shorten the feedback loop between themselves, end-users, and key stakeholders so that development is effective and efficient. This in turn leads to greater success in the delivery of app projects, lower development costs, and shortened time- to-market.

When development activities on the Mendix Platform extend to a large number of teams, some organizations require more advanced project management tools and services. For this scenario, the Mendix Platform provides APIs for [integration with third-party tools and services](requirements-management#tools).
