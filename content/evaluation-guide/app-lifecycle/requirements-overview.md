## 1 Why Is Requirements Management Fully Embedded in the Mendix Platform?

{{% todo %}}This should be a featured question{{% /todo %}}

Development teams need to deliver applications that achieve business objectives from day 1 and match & exceed userâ€™s needs & expectations. But at the same time the applications must stay current with changes in these objectives, needs & expectations throughout the lifetime of the applications.

In order for the development team to be able to cope with these demands, the team needs a thorough understanding of those business objectives & user needs. This means they need to better understand their business stakeholders and the users of the application. Collaboratively, as an extended team, they need to create a deep shared understanding of requirements. And as these requirements evolve throughout the lifetime of the application, so must the shared understanding of the extended team evolve.

Between development team, key users and business stakeholders, assumptions must be validated, feedback must be collected and in general incorrect understanding must be set straight. This means that the extended team needs an integrated environment in which requirements, releases, feedback and communication are brought together and which facilitates continuous interaction.

The Mendix Developer Portal provides the extended team with a central space to manage their application requirements in a backlog of user stories. The development team, business stakeholders and key users can all access this space, which provides everyone involved with a single, integrated view on all requirements and where they can collaborate on fleshing out the details. The extended team can comment on every user story or feedback item so that questions can be quickly answered and details specified further. This [Buzz feed](collaboration-channels#buzz) is available in the context of every user story and feedback item, but also centrally visible at the project level, both on the desktop and through the [Mendix Mobile app](collaboration-channels#mxapp).

## 2 How Is Requirements Management Positioned in Mendix?

Requirements management is a critical part of the application development lifecycle. Mendix helps to shorten the feedback loop between development teams and users as well as all other stakeholders in order to drive project success, lower costs, and decrease time-to-market.

## 3 How Does Mendix Support Agile Development Teams?

Mendix enables development teams to adopt an Agile approach based on Scrum in which they collaborate closely with internal and external stakeholders in short iterative development cycles. The Mendix Platform supports this way of working out of the box through the following key functionalities:

* **Development teams** can [capture, refine, and prioritize requirements](requirements-management#requirements-management) for their applications in the Mendix Developer Portal with a full-fledged user-story and task backlog management tool
* **Users and other stakeholders** can review apps and [provide feedback](feedback-management#feedback-management) to the development team so that apps can be quickly improved, both during development and after go-live
* **All stakeholders of the app under development** can be [actively engaged](collaboration-channels#stakeholder-involvement) in the development process through different channels

Mendix helps development teams shorten the feedback loop between themselves, end-users, and key stakeholders so that development is effective and efficient. This in turn leads to greater success in the delivery of app projects, lower development costs, and shortened time-to-market.

When development activities on the Mendix Platform extend to a large number of teams, some organizations require more advanced project management tools and services on top of Mendix Requirements Management. For this scenario, the Mendix Platform provides APIs for [integration with third-party tools and services](requirements-management#tooling).
