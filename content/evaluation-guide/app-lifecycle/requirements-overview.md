## 1 Why Is It Important that Requirements Management Is Fully Embedded in the Mendix Platform?

{{% todo %}}Discuss: Should this be a featured question?{{% /todo %}}

Requirements management is fully embedded in the Mendix Platform because of the reasons described in detail below.

### 1.1 Meeting Demands on Delivered Apps as They Evolve Over Time

Development teams need to deliver applications that achieve business objectives from day 1 and match & exceed userâ€™s needs & expectations while staying current with changes in these objectives, needs & expectations throughout the lifetime of the applications. In order for the development team to be truly effective, they need a thorough understanding of those business objectives & user needs. This means they need to better understand their business stakeholders who identified the need for the application, and users who will actually use the application. Collaboratively, they need to create a deep shared understanding of business objectives, user needs and expectations. However, because objectives, needs and expectations evolve throughout the lifetime of the application, so must the shared understanding of the extended team evolve.

### 1.2 Building a Shared Understanding of Objectives & Needs in the Extended Team

So how does the extended team get to a shared understanding of those business objectives, user needs, and in turn, application requirements? Development teams need to be infused with business knowledge in order for them to be able to properly understand what application to build. This means that business stakeholders shouldn't just provide written-down requirements specifications. Instead, they should share their domain expertise with the team in order to clarify requirements. Finally, continuous feedback from users is essential for the team to understand the needs of those users.

These reuqirements means that the extended team needs an integrated environment in which they are encouraged to interact continuously between development team, key users and business stakeholders so that assumptions can be validated, feedback can be gathered and in general incorrect understanding can be set straight.

### 1.3 Collaborating on Business Requirements via the Mendix Platform

The Mendix Platform enables development teams, users and other stakeholders to grow this shared understanding of the business requirements through multiple channels that are completely integrated into the platform.

The Mendix Developer Portal provides the extended team with a central space to manage their application requirements in a backlog of user stories. The development team, business stakeholders and key users can all access this space, which provides everyone involved with a single, integrated view on all requirements and where they can collaborate on fleshing out the details. The extended team can comment on every user story or feedback item so that questions can be quickly answered and details specified further. This [Buzz feed](collaboration-channels#buzz) is available in the context of every user story and feedback item, but also centrally visible at the project level, both on the desktop and through the [Mendix Mobile app](collaboration-channels#mxapp).

Once initial ideas about requirements have been specified, the development team can quickly prototype their application and [publish an early version to the Mendix Cloud](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/howto/deploying-to-the-cloud#5-deploying-a-free-app-to-the-mendix-cloud). Key users can then be involved from the start of the development process to [provide feedback](feedback-management#feedback-management) to the development team by testing previews of actually working applications.

Through this collaborative environment, the development team is essentially redefined: Business developers and professional developers form the new development team, bringing their domain specific knowledge together with technical knowledge to deliver improved and more complete applications. This enables the delivery of solutions that are not compromised by a skill limit or limited expertise in domains outside of the purview of the development team as team members with domain specific knowledge can naturally contribute their expert knowledge into the project. And continuous, bidirectional information flow guides project development to ensure it meets its business goals.

When the development team truly understands business objectives & user needs, instead of delivering an application that implements imperfect and incomplete requirements, the team can deliver applications that are truly unparalleled in meeting business demands & user needs.

## 2 How Is Requirements Management Positioned in Mendix?

Requirements management is a critical part of the application development lifecycle. Mendix helps to shorten the feedback loop between development teams and users as well as all other stakeholders in order to drive project success, lower costs, and decrease time-to-market.

## 3 How Does Mendix Support Agile Development Teams?

Mendix enables development teams to adopt an Agile approach based on Scrum in which they collaborate closely with internal and external stakeholders in short iterative development cycles. The Mendix Platform supports this way of working out of the box through the following key functionalities:

* Development teams can [capture, refine, and prioritize requirements](requirements-management#requirements-management) for their applications in the Mendix Developer Portal with a full-fledged user-story and task backlog management tool
* Users and other stakeholders can review apps and [provide feedback](feedback-management#feedback-management) to the development team so that apps can be quickly improved, both during development and after go-live
* All the stakeholders of the app under development can be [actively engaged](collaboration-channels#stakeholder-involvement) in the development process through different channels

Mendix helps development teams shorten the feedback loop between themselves, end-users, and key stakeholders so that development is effective and efficient. This in turn leads to greater success in the delivery of app projects, lower development costs, and shortened time- to-market.

When development activities on the Mendix Platform extend to a large number of teams, some organizations require more advanced project management tools and services. For this scenario, the Mendix Platform provides APIs for [integration with third-party tools and services](requirements-management#tooling).
