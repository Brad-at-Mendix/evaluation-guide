## 3 How Does Mendix Support Feedback Management? {#feedback-management}

Collecting feedback from users and other stakeholders, prioritizing the feedback, and acting on crucial items is essential to the success of application delivery projects, both during development and after go-live. Mendix provides a [Mendix Feedback Widget](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/199/) that empowers the end-users of an app to submit feedback from the context of the app itself. Feedback items are submitted through the widget into the [Feedback](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/collaborate/feedback) section of the app project in the Developer Portal. This allows end-users to very easily provide valuable feedback to the development team on the app under development.

The development team can review and triage feedback items in the **Feedback** section of the Developer Portal. They can communicate with the submitter of the feedback item through messages on the Buzz thread under the item.

In this way, the Mendix Platform enables development teams to fully integrate user feedback into their natural development cycle. By integrating selected feedback as user stories into the backlog, the team can schedule these user stories as part of their sprint planning. At the end of every sprint, when the active sprint is closed and the next sprint is opened, all the feedback items that were scheduled as user stories are closed, and status change notifications are sent to the respective submitters.

End-users can keep track of submitted feedback through the Developer Portal and post updates and replies to questions. As with all Buzz activity, email notifications are sent when someone replies to your post. Users can quickly open the Developer Portal from those emails, or just reply by email to post a response.

This functionality enables a very fast feedback loop between the development team, key end-users, and other stakeholders, in turn enabling quick improvement of the app under development.
