## How Can I Quickstart My App Development Project?

The Mendix Platform comes with a series of Starter Apps which provide all the scaffolding needed to get started building your first App. Starter Apps combine with ready-made open source components downloaded from our App Store such as Theme Packs, UI and Logic to further accelerate the delivery of your first App. Create your company specific Starter Apps and App Store components and store them in your companies private Enterprise App Store to accelerate App delivery even further.

## Where Do I Start with the Mendix Platform?

Firstly you will need to sign up to the platform itself using the ‘Start for Free’ button found on the Mendix website. Once signed up you will be guided through a carefully planned onboarding experience, which only takes a few minutes, but it will give you the grounding you need to get started building your first App in Mendix. From there head over to the rich and diverse Mendix Community and Forum, or visit our Academy and get started on one of our many Learning Paths.
