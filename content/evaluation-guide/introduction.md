The Mendix platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across your entire application development lifecycle from ideation to development, deployment, and the ongoing management of your application portfolio in the cloud or on premises. 

Mendix offers both **no-code** (visual-modelling) and **low code** (highly extensible, integrated tooling to support cross-functional teams working collaboratively). Business-domain experts such as analysts and citizen developers can work alongside expert developers to achieve much greater levels of business agility and consequently accelerated delivery, while the platform's cloud-native architecture and automation tools support the deployment, management, and monitoring of highly-available enterprise-grade applications.

Based around our three core principles of **speed**, **collaboration**, and **control**, Mendix offers a complete platform for your enterprise application delivery needs.

## What Is the Vision Behind Mendix?

Our vision in a world where software is the lifeblood of every company is to empower people with diverse skills and backgrounds to collaborate successfully and create better software that delivers true business value faster and at significantly lower costs. 

The Mendix Platform brings together the people with ideas and the people that have the technical aptitude to execute on them to create a powerful force for change, which we believe is necessary to compete and survive in a software-driven world.

## How Does Mendix Optimize the Collaboration Between Business & IT?

{{% todo %}}[**This question section is not yet written, and was previously specified as a Prio2 question. Should it be written for inclusion in v1 as a featured question, or should the featured question be changed (and Nick would have to rewrite this featured question brief answer)? Fix link below when resolved.**]{{% /todo %}}

To achieve the high levels of agility and continuous interactions required to collaborate effectively across multi-disciplinary teams, Mendix combines the following elements:

* **Abstraction** through visual model-driven development tools
* **Automation** via continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
* **Intelligent assisted development** with a fully integrated feed that maps every interaction across the ALM to a central portal buzz

Project team members are connected instantly and interactively to changes and updates, such as new requirements, software revisions, updates, and shipments as well as test results and feedback loops from end-users. This live feed becomes the backbone for the collaborative process, while visual models and drag-and-drop WYSYWG editors lower the barrier to entry for business users to participate in the development process.

Mendix is a fully open platform that leverages open standards and open-source technologies to meet the demands of today's enterprise software delivery requirements. Our Twelve-Factor -compatible cloud-native and stateless architecture supports highly available and scalable solutions running in container technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry or on top of windows or Linux.

Openness and extensibility hooks are available across the platform, from the client and server-side APIs for custom model extensions to the Mendix Platform APIs and our open-source Model SDK, which allows you to integrate Mendix with your existing tools (CI/CD and DevOps) as well as to build scripts to manage, monitor, and modify the core metadata of your apps.
