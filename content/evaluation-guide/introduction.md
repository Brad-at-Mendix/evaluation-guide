The Mendix platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across your entire application development lifecycle from ideation to development, deployment and the on-going management of your application portfolio in the cloud or on-premise.

Mendix offers both **No code**: visual-modelling and **Low-code**: highly extensible, integrated tooling to support cross-functional teams working collaboratively. Business-domain experts such as analysts and citizen developers can work alongside expert developers to achieve much greater levels of business agility and consequently accelerated delivery, while the platforms cloud-native architecture and automation tools support the deployment, management and monitoring of highly available Enterprise grade applications.

Based around our three core principles of Speed, Collaboration and Control Mendix offers a complete platform for your enterprise application delivery needs.

## What Is the Vision Behind Mendix? {#vision}

Our vision in a world where software is the lifeblood of every company is to empower people with diverse skills and backgrounds to collaborate successfully to create better software, that delivers true business value, faster and at significantly lower costs than ever before.

The Mendix platform brings together the people with ideas and the people that have the technical aptitude to execute on them to create a powerful force for change, which we believe is necessary to compete and survive in a software-driven world.

## How Does Mendix Optimize the Collaboration Between Business & IT? {#optimize-collaboration}

To achieve the high levels of agility and continuous interactions required to collaborate effectively across multi-disciplinary teams, Mendix combines **abstraction:** visual model-driven development tools, **automation:** continuous integration and deployment (CICD), and **intelligent assisted development** with a fully integrated feed that maps every interaction across the ALM to a central buzz.

Project team members are connected instantly and interactively to changes and updates: such as new requirements, software revisions, updates and shipments; as well as test results and feedback loops from end users. This live feed becomes the backbone for the collaborative process, while visual models and drag and drop WYSYWG editors lower the barrier to entry for business users to participate in the development process.

## What Does the Mendix Architecture Look Like? {#architecture}

Mendix is a fully open platform that leverages open standards and open source technologies to meet the demands of today's enterprise software delivery requirements. Our 12-factor compatible cloud-native, stateless architecture supports highly available, scalable solutions running in container technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry or on top of windows or Linux.

Openness and extensibility hooks are available across the platform, from the client and server-side APIs for custom model extensions to the platform APIs and our open-source Model SDK, which allows you to integrate Mendix with your existing tools (CICD/ Dev Ops) and build scripts to manage/monitor and modify the core metadata of your apps.
