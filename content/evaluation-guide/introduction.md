The Mendix platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across your entire application development lifecycle from ideation to development, deployment, and the ongoing management of your application portfolio in the cloud or on premises. 

Mendix offers both **no-code** (visual-modelling) and **low code** (highly extensible, integrated tooling to support cross-functional teams working collaboratively). Business-domain experts such as analysts and citizen developers can work alongside expert developers to achieve much greater levels of business agility and consequently accelerated delivery, while the platform's cloud-native architecture and automation tools support the deployment, management, and monitoring of highly-available enterprise-grade applications.

Based around our three core principles of **speed**, **collaboration**, and **control**, Mendix offers a complete platform for your enterprise application delivery needs.
